I’m Fabio Milentiansen Sim, a Research Engineer at Nomura Research Institute. I research, build, and optimize machine learning systems, with a focus on large language models and computer vision. I’m a polyglot in English, Japanese, Chinese, Indonesian, and German.

I grew up in Jakarta, Indonesia. In 2020, I earned a double-degree: a B.Eng. in Mechatronics Engineering (summa cum laude) from Swiss German University and a B.Eng. from South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences. My thesis focused on physics machine learning: using deep learning to solve differential equations and model physical systems.

I’m certified on AWS (Machine Learning, Data Analytics), Google Cloud (Professional Machine Learning Engineer, Professional Data Engineer), and Microsoft Azure (AI Engineer Associate, Data Scientist Associate).

In 2021, I was a participant at the Apple Developer Academy @ BINUS University, where I built five apps across Apple platforms, focusing on machine learning, image processing, and augmented reality. Earlier, in 2019, I interned at the Institute of Power Systems and Power Economics in Soest, Germany, working on Python-based algorithms and Docker-based system integration for TensorFlow and graph visualization tooling.
